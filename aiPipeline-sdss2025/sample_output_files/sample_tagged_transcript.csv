Interviewee,"Yes. There's a tutoring program where we have two coordinators for that program and so at is pretty self-sufficient in that they identify which students are going to be a part of that program because it's based upon academic need, and also specific grade-level band of second through fifth grade, and that was decided district-wide, so it's a district-wide initiative. But each elementary school has, I believe, a coordinator that runs that program and does the staffing, and so they have those classroom tutors as well.",Are there are other leadership opportunities for teachers and staff outside of the instructional leadership team?,Leadership and Vision,1B, Distributed Leadership and Sustainability ,"School leaders engage all or nearly all staff in schoolwide improvement efforts through intentional teaming structures, and individuals have opportunities to take on leadership opportunities.School leaders have put some teaming structures in place to facilitate shared leadership responsibility.

Interviewer,We understand it's the life of the leadership.,,,,,
Interviewer,"Okay, so then I want to stick with the school improvement team, and just thinking how does that team use data to monitor and adjust school initiatives or priorities, and how frequently?","How does your leadership team use data to monitor and adjust school initiatives or priorities, and how frequently do you review and act on this data to support student progress?",Leadership and Vision,1C,Culture of Continuous Improvement,"School leaders have a plan for a consistent way for monitoring improvement using the elements of continuous improvement, and there is evidence that they use data to prioritize initiatives to meet evolving teacher and student needs.School leaders communicate clearly with all relevant staff about progress and challenges of improvement efforts.

Interviewee,"Yeah, so we developed the school improvement plan based upon the end of the year progress that was made, and so that's to begin with, and so the goals were established based upon then at that time how closely we had met those previous goals in academics and in our attendance. So it was math, reading, and attendance, and last year we looked at SEL as another measure. This school year we were told to just pick three, so it was math, literacy, and in attendance, and so in June of last year, 2024, we had decided on what the those percentages or increase of progress where we're expecting to make going a little bit further than the growth from previous years to make sure that the goals were rigorous. When we met again in the fall, before the school year started, we revisited those goals before then knowing that we were gonna present our school improvement goals to the staff. And so by that time I had, principals had all had, we have like a leadership institute basically, you called it, basically an admin, not academy, but institute, they call it. And we knew that the expectation was a certain goalpost for our map data. And so we adjusted, we knew that going in that our expectation was that at least 50% of our students needed to make adequate progress with their projected map goals. And so knowing that, I knew that we needed to push the needle and on our percentage that we had already. And so we decided then to make sure that it was consistent with what the district's goal was at that time. And so presented to the staff. And so throughout the school year, we've been doing things that are really tied to each of those, whether it be looking at data for map for our building. So we have different, three different benchmarks. So in the winter we gave some kudos to looking at, okay, well, great. We really met it in English language arts. We were almost there for math and talked about that. We did some individual goal setting for all students and not just as far as what the score is gonna be, but also within that individual setting template that provided what foundational skills were students needing if it was math or ELA. So those things were on there as well. So students knew that they weren't just trying to achieve a number, but also there was some, a learning goal, right? Tied to do that.","How does your leadership team use data to monitor and adjust school initiatives or priorities, and how frequently do you review and act on this data to support student progress?",Leadership and Vision,1C,Culture of Continuous Improvement,"School leaders have a plan for a consistent way for monitoring improvement using the elements of continuous improvement, and there is evidence that they use data to prioritize initiatives to meet evolving teacher and student needs.School leaders communicate clearly with all relevant staff about progress and challenges of improvement efforts.

Interviewer,And that makes it a little more personal.,,,,,
Interviewee,"Yeah, absolutely. And so, and then attendance, I have a weekly or I wanna say biweekly, I should say meetings with, we have a position that's called the SEAA. So that is a student engagement advocate for attendance. And we, him and I look at where we're at with, with chronic absenteeism because that's our focus for that goal. We look at that monthly and see which students are on there. But then also our school improvement team looks at that separately, right? And just if they have any other input that they would like me to bring to my meeting with him, I also bring that as well. So I see the leadership team or the school improvement team kind of like as our problem solving tank and coming up with some actionable steps.","How does your leadership team use data to monitor and adjust school initiatives or priorities, and how frequently do you review and act on this data to support student progress?",Leadership and Vision,1C,Culture of Continuous Improvement,"School leaders have a plan for a consistent way for monitoring improvement using the elements of continuous improvement, and there is evidence that they use data to prioritize initiatives to meet evolving teacher and student needs.School leaders communicate clearly with all relevant staff about progress and challenges of improvement efforts.
