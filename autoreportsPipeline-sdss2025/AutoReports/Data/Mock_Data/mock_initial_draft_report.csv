Sample School- Sample District,"Sample has multiple structures that support positive interpersonal relationships between teachers and students and between staff members (e.g., advisories, SEL curriculum, spirit week). These positive relationships provide an environment that is conducive to learning for all students, as evidenced by the school's clear and consistently enforced behavioral expectations.",Sample has established strong relationships with community organizations that provide students and families with programming and resources that caters to the unique needs of the diverse community. Teachers have the ability to proactively assess students' needs and refer students and families to services that are best suited to meet their needs.,"Sample prioritizes social-emotional learning strategies using the “7 Mindsets” program and curriculum. Lessons occur daily, helping teachers to support students’ social-emotional wellbeing and develop positive relationships with their peers and teachers. Teachers have access to additional social-emotional supports throughout the day (e.g., through Buddy rooms).","Sample uses data to address disparities in attendance and discipline, and these efforts have improved student outcomes. However, while Sample tracks and reviews data for historically marginalized groups, actions taken in response to these data reviews may be infrequent or limited.","The school supports teachers' professional growth through regular observations, feedback, and monthly professional development (PD) opportunities. However, PD is primarily district-directed and does not consistently address current instructional needs, as staff have few opportunities to provide input regarding the content. Teachers also lack the support they received from an instructional in coach in prior years.","Although Sample teachers are provided with twice-weekly PLC sessions, opportunities for collaboration can be limited, as other agenda items often take precedence. Some teachers meet informally outside of PLC time to plan for instruction, given the limited opportunities for collaborative planning. ","While all staff survey respondents (100%) agreed or strongly agreed that they are familiar with the school's instructional goals and vision, school leaders shared varying perspectives on the extent to which the goals and vision have been finalized. Leaders indicated that the instructional vision which focuses on achievement in reading, math, and improvement in chronic absenteeism, and these priorities are included in the school improvement plan created by the ULT (Universal Leadership Team).","Evidence of Elevating Educators (EJC): While most staff survey respondents (84%) agreed or strongly agreed that they are involved in determining the school's instructional vision and school-wide priorities, staff focus group participants reported that they had little to no input in shaping the school's vision and goals. Staff focus group participants also agreed that family members had limited involvement in the development of the instructional vision and goals due to their lack of time and engagement opportunities.","While school leaders agreed that the school is in the developing stages of establishing specific goals and plans aligned to the instructional vision, they reported that the school has a process for reviewing benchmarks to measure progress. The staff focus group participants reported that the ULT monitors at least one strategy monthly and utilizes data evidence to assess progress and decide on next steps.
","Evidence of Elevating Educators (EJC): According to school leaders and staff focus group participants, most staff engage in at least one school committee (e.g., AVID, attendance, SEL, parent involvement, and ULT). Some leadership opportunities are available within each committee to support distributed leadership.","School leaders reported that the ULT consists of grade level representatives, all administrative staff, and some support staff. Staff focus group participants agreed that the ULT keeps staff informed of school improvement efforts, but several participants described a need for improved school-wide communication from the ULT.","School leaders reported that they use data to monitor and adjust school initiatives. Staff corroborated this report, as all staff survey participants (100%) agreed or strongly agreed that school leaders regularly review data on school progress. Leaders described using a structured approach to focus on a different strategy each month (e.g., addressing chronic absenteeism), identify areas of improvement, and make necessary adjustments.","According to school leaders, the school uses data to address disparities in attendance and discipline (e.g., conducting home visits for families with poor attendance). Leaders report that these data utilization efforts have improved student outcomes. According to staff focus group participants, the ULT members share progress updates with grade level groups, and nearly all staff survey respondents (95%) agreed or strongly agreed that school leaders communicate with staff about whether improvement efforts are effective.","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): While two-thirds of staff survey respondents (67%) indicated that school leaders review data and track progress for historically marginalized groups multiple times per month (or more often), school leaders acknowledged that there is currently a lack of action in response to these data reviews.","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): Nearly three-quarter of staff survey respondents (70%) indicated they receive professional development (PD) on effective instruction at least quarterly. However, PD related to differentiating instruction to support multilingual learners and students with IEPs may be less consistent, as staff survey respondents reported a wide range of frequencies with which they have had opportunities to participate in PD focused on differentiating instruction for these groups. Staff focus group participants agreed that PD occurs monthly, but they noted that it is primarily directed by the district, and staff have limited input. Some participants shared that district-directed PD is often not effective or relevant to staff's instructional needs or content areas.","Most staff survey participants (81%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school has a system in place for observing teachers and providing feedback. School leaders reported that teachers receive informal walk-throughs/observations that result in feedback or questions 3-5 times a week, but due to union regulations, teachers are not required to respond to the inquires.","Approximately half (48%) of staff survey respondents reported they never have the opportunity to work with an instructional coach. Staff focus group participants corroborated this report, noting that the school no longer has an instructional coach. ","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): School leaders reported that the curriculum selection process includes consideration of cultural responsiveness, though this factor may have limited influence on curriculum decisions. Staff focus group participants indicated that some curricula include some culturally responsive elements, but these elements are not deeply integrated into the learning experience. Participants also indicated that K-3 dual language immersion teachers have access to a Spanish curriculum, but there is no Spanish curriculum provided for grades 4-8.","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): While staff survey respondents overwhelmingly agreed that curriculum materials have been reviewed for alignment to standards (97%) and for quality (e.g., by looking at third-party ratings) (97%), fewer agreed that the materials meet the needs of students with diverse learning needs, such as those with IEPs (75%) or multilingual learners (77%). Staff focus group participants reported that some curricula are not easily modifiable for special populations, such as students with IEPs.","The majority of staff survey respondents (96%) agreed or strongly agreed that school leaders monitor classrooms for consistency in implementing curriculum. School leaders described supporting fidelity of implementation through district-provided trainings, piloting of new curricula, observations, planning meetings, and assessments.",Staff focus group participants and school leaders agreed that teachers regularly engage in two collaborative planning sessions per week in the form of PLCs. Both groups stated that the collaborative planning time is structured differently each week with specific focuses set by the district. School leaders agree that PLCs are curriculum-focused and tailored to the needs of some teachers.,Over one-third of staff survey participants (37%) disagreed or strongly disagreed they meet with colleagues regularly to plan lessons. Staff focus group participants indicated that district-focused collaborative planning sessions in particular do not allow for teachers to collaborate in planning for instruction.,"Staff focus group participants shared that the AVID program has been raising school-wide expectations and providing instructional strategies to support high expectations. School leaders also reported that AVID strategies keep the curriculum engaging and meaningful for students. However, staff focus group participants noted a discrepancy in the level of AVID training among staff, with some teachers feeling adequately trained while others are not, which may impact the consistency of AVID implementation. ","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): Nearly all staff survey respondents (97%) agreed or strongly agreed that teachers have a collective understanding of best practices and strategies for engaging students from historically underserved backgrounds in rigorous instruction. School leaders similarly reported that efforts to integrate culturally responsive practices into the curriculum to contribute to high expectations and rigorous instruction for all students. For example, teachers are integrating culturally responsive practices through project-based learning, which supports rigorous instruction by engaging students in meaningful, standards-aligned work.","Almost all staff survey participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that school leaders actively monitor the level of rigor in teaching at the school. This perception aligns with school leaders' reports that teachers receive classroom observations regularly, sometimes on a daily basis.","School leaders reported conducting regular walk-throughs to monitor teacher quality and collect data on the types teaching methods used by teachers. The majority of staff survey participants (88%) corroborated this report, indicating that they receive classroom observation visits and walk-throughs from school leaders at least quarterly.","According to staff focus group participants, formal evaluative observations are scheduled on the basis of teachers' tenure and ratings. Participants agreed that his formal evaluation process using the Danielson model is through and beneficial for identifying areas for improvement.","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): Nearly three-quarter of staff survey respondents (72%) indicated that they examine and discuss academic data (e.g., standardized tests, benchmark assessments) at least quarterly, and 88% agreed or strongly agreed that they regularly examine data to identify the needs of special populations. School leaders reported that data analysis is integrated into PLC time and specifically mentioned analyzing IXL and NWA data to monitor student learning, identify students who are struggling, and guide instruction.","School leaders mostly agreed that resources are available to support teachers' data use and reported that the school is incorporating data use into their professional development sessions. Staff focus group participants described hearing brief data talks from the district and having some time to analyze data by reviewing student work, but perceived these opportunities as being infrequent and limited.","Most staff survey participants (81%) indicated that they routinely discuss nonacademic data on a quarterly or more basis. For example, staff focus group participants reported that staff discuss discipline related to specific students, but these conversations are more prevalent for middle school teachers.","All staff survey respondents (100%) agreed or strongly agreed that teachers genuinely care about the students. Staff focus group participants similarly reported positive teacher-student relationships, noting that the school has systems to support and sustain these relationships (e.g., SEL curriculum, advisories, and buddy room system).","School leaders described a strong sense of community and collegiality among the staff, fostered through activities such as spirit week, staff recognitions, and potlucks. Staff survey responses supported this report, as the majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that teachers respect one another as colleagues (93%) and support one another to be better (96%). ","Although school leaders held mixed opinions, the majority of staff survey respondents (91%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school community universally understands behavioral expectations.","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): The majority of staff survey respondents (81%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school has expectations for student conduct that are enforced consistently no matter who the students are. Staff focus group participants agreed that behavioral expectations are consistent for most students but noted that maintaining consistency for students with IEPs, particularly those receiving additional behavioral and emotional support, can be challenging. ","Nearly all staff survey participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the schedule includes adequate time to teach social-emotional learning strategies. School leaders explained that the ""7 Mindsets"" program is an integral part of the school's SEL curriculum and is taught daily. School leaders also described using Panorama to monitor social-emotional learning. ","The majority of staff survey respondents (86%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school solicits feedback from students. School leaders indicated that the school gathers student feedback through formal surveys conducted three times per year; informal surveys to gather feedback on celebrations, behavioral rules, and items at the student store; and noting informal comments students share with teachers. ","According to staff focus group participants and school leaders, the school has a parent involvement committee that organizes quarterly family engagement events such as parent nights, PTO meetings, movie nights, grandparents' day, and cultural heritage events. The majority of staff survey respondents (95%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school has at least one staff member who takes primary responsibility for parent and family engagement.","Staff focus group participants described various strategies the school uses to communicate with parents, including Class Dojo, Facebook, robocalls, texts, emails, and phone calls. However, school leaders perceived that a lack of trust between families and the school can sometimes hinder effective family collaboration regarding academics.","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): Both school leader and staff surveys indicated that that school works to engage linguistically diverse families, with 100% of staff agreeing or strongly agreeing that the school communicates in multiple languages to accommodate families who speak other languages. Staff focus group participants added that dual language teachers help support other teachers with translation needs.  ","School leaders described strong partnerships with community organizations to support the school's goals and address students' diverse needs. For example, partnerships with Komatsu and First United Methodist Church provide resources and support that school leaders described as being crucial for students and families. Nearly all staff survey respondents (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school actively seeks out ways to be innovative when combining in-school and community supports to meet the students' and families' needs, and 100% of staff agreed or strongly agreed that staff try to be proactive in addressing student or family needs with community supports.","Almost all staff survey participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school has a system in place for connecting students and families with community resources. School leaders also agreed that the school has a system to identify students in need, noting that teachers play a key role in recommending support resources to students and families. ","School leaders highlighted the significant role of community organizations in providing essential resources through financial, supplies, and services to support to the school. For example, the Classroom Closet program allows teachers to request supplies, and community partners fulfill the requests. Komatsu has also supported the school by leading the LEGO Robotics team, donating a scoreboard, and providing financial assistance to families. While community partnerships offer a variety of after-school programs, clubs, mentoring, and extracurricular activities for a large percentage of students, the high demand for these programs prevents some students from participating due to capacity limits.","Staff focus group participants and school leaders reported that the school has teams to review student academic and social-emotional data and assign supports. Most staff survey respondents concurred, with 94% agreeing or strongly agreeing that there is a team that monitors the delivery and effectiveness of academic supports, and 97% agreeing or strongly agreeing that there is a team that monitors social-emotional supports. In addition, school leaders reported that the social-emotional team also reviews school-wide behavior through the use of the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) framework.","While teams are in place to monitor student supports, both school leaders and staff focus group participants indicated that the process of getting students into the Multitiered Systems of Supports (MTSS) could be challenging, and that the documentation process for interventions is time-consuming and complex. School leaders reported that the MTSS was not being utilized as much as it should be, and that teachers may need additional training on how to use the intervention platform (Panorama). ","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): Most staff survey respondents (89%) agreed or strongly agreed that push-in supports are available for students who require more individualized help. However, staff focus group participants indicated that push-in supports are not consistently available, which may hinder differentiated and inclusive instruction.  ","School leaders described the school's efforts to support differentiation and inclusion across all grades. For example, teacher-created lesson plans include AVID strategies, and school leaders review these plans. School leaders also monitor teaching methods through daily classroom walkthroughs, looking for AVID strategies and small group instruction as evidence that staff are supporting diverse student needs. In addition, 91% of staff survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a majority of their instruction is grounded in Universal Design for Learning principals, which supports differentiation and inclusion.","Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): While most school leaders agreed that school classrooms provide inclusive grade-level instruction supported by co-teaching or push-in special education, focus group participants reported that challenges in getting students into the MTSS can prevent students from receiving timely support. ","Enrichment learning opportunities are available to most students through the 21st Century After-School Program, which provides a variety of after-school programming (e.g., art, choir, orchestra, band, athletics and a Chess Club and Ukulele Club). The Komatsu organization partners with the school to support youth and families and runs an after-school Lego Robotics Club.","Although the majority of staff survey participants (72%) agreed or strongly agreed that students can choose their enrichment opportunities, school leaders mostly disagreed that students have choice regarding enrichment activities. For example, school leaders noted that teachers decide which students are eligible to participate in the Lego Robotics Club. ","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): Although approximately two-thirds of staff survey respondents (68%) agreed or strongly agreed that the school's enrichment opportunities include advanced coursework, school leaders reported that at the time of the visit, students only had opportunities to level up in math, and only a few middle school students were currently working at a higher grade level. Additionally, 19% of staff survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that advanced learning opportunities are monitored for access.",Established,"Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, school leadership and most staff are engaged in improvement efforts, though meaningful leadership opportunities are limited for a truly diverse range of staff members.

Teachers sometimes work in grade-level content teams to use data to examine student progress. While most staff do use data to form appropriate action steps, a system for consistently monitoring student results is not in place. There are indications of professional development related to data analysis but barriers to consistent or efficient data use.","Consistent with a robust rating, school leadership and staff have taken a holistic approach to fostering positive interpersonal relationships. The school has multiple structures (e.g., advisories, SEL curriculum, buddy rooms) that support positive teacher–student relationships; there are also clear signs of professional trust among most staff and practices to support these staff relationships. While school leaders and staff report overwhelmingly positive relationships between staff members, both identified opportunities to extend these positive relationships to staff who may not currently experience them.","Consistent with a robust rating, school leadership and staff prioritize direct instructional support for social-emotional (SEL) competencies, and these practices are integrated into the curriculum, used in all classrooms daily, and implementation is tailored to meet students' needs. School leadership and staff have established an environment that has clear and consistent behavioral expectations, as well as created a safe and nurturing environment. These have been implemented consistently throughout the school, although some staff struggle to maintain consistency of expectations for students with IEPs.","Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, school leadership and staff engage families. These efforts include a dedicated parent involvement committee to support family engagement, quarterly activities for families, consistent staff outreach, and communications in multiple languages. However, at the time of the visit, the school lacked an established space for families.","Consistent with a robust rating for this indicator, school leaders and staff have established several connections with community organizations, including processes where teachers proactively assess students' needs and offer wraparound services. Partnerships with community organizations help the school meet students' and families' needs in both traditional and innovative ways (e.g., after-school programming, school supplies, financial assistance).","Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, school leadership and staff implement a system of academic and social emotional supports. The system(s) includes important features, including a team of staff to review academic and social emotional needs and assignments, reviews of intervention assignments at least every 6 weeks, consistent roles and procedures for supports, and a communication plan to all relevant staff. However, at the time of the visit there were some concerns regarding the processes in place for students to receive interventions, as well as the current amount and scope of provided supports.  ","Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, most students have access to individualized supports, and instruction in most classrooms is grounded in Universal Design for Learning (UDL) practices, offering students access to high-quality, grade-appropriate instruction. Some teachers use scaffolds to support student learning, with CLASS scores for Quality of Feedback (which includes scaffolding) falling in the middle range. Push-in and co-teaching supports are available to allow students with individualized needs to participate in classes without regular exclusion. In addition, the school uses the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program, which supports differentiated and inclusive instruction.","Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, school leaders and staff offer enrichment and advanced learning opportunities to most students through a 21st Century After-School program, and a partnership with the Komatsu organization. The opportunities that are available do offer some student choice and expose students to new interests.  However, these options are not monitored regularly for quality and access.  ","School leadership has a defined instructional vision, along with improvement priorities or goals, but may not have specific benchmarks for measuring progress toward all goals. School leadership determines schoolwide priorities without input from members of the broader school community. School leadership and most staff members understand the instructional vision and priorities for improvement. There is a sense of shared ownership for all students and schoolwide improvement among most staff, as evident through actions and conversations.","School leadership engages most staff in schoolwide improvement efforts through intentional teaming structures; however, there are limited opportunities for individual staff to take on leadership opportunities (e.g., decision-making authority). School leadership has already put some teaming structures in place to facilitate shared leadership responsibility; however, opportunities may exist to further broaden participation to involve a more diverse range of staff members. School leadership acknowledges sustainability as a priority and successfully use some distributed leadership strategies.","School leadership has a plan for a consistent way for monitoring improvement using the elements of continuous improvement, but there is limited evidence that they use data to prioritize initiatives and to refine (and improve) strategies to meet evolving teacher and student needs. School leadership has established systems for communicating about progress and challenges of improvement efforts, but some barriers to communication may still exist. School leadership has begun using schoolwide data to monitor the effectiveness of some key initiatives, but there is little to no evidence that the data are analyzed by student groups. School leadership occasionally seeks input from the broader school community about progress on improvement efforts. ","Most staff participate in regular professional development and growth opportunities designed to enhance school and classroom practices, and most opportunities align with the school’s instructional vision and improvement goals. School leadership develops professional development plans based on areas of need as identified by schoolwide data and provide most staff whole-group learning opportunities based on priority areas identified. There is a system for conducting observations (including peer observations) and providing teachers with targeted coaching, but all staff do not receive coaching or are not able to access peer observation opportunities.","The school has a documented, evidence-based curriculum for at least two core content areas (ELA, math, or science), but meets only two or three of the following criteria: (a) The curriculum is aligned across grade levels and is standards aligned; (b) The curriculum is culturally responsive; (c) There is a system in place to support the fidelity of implementation of curriculum efforts; (d) School leaders use an inclusive review process that regularly assesses the efficacy of the curriculum to support improved student outcomes.","The school has systems and structures in place to support teachers’ collaborative planning. Collaborative time is protected, and there are opportunities for all staff to participate. However, there is some limitation in either vertical or horizontal alignment and planning.  Most teachers engage in regularly (at least twice per month) scheduled planning for instruction, but some barriers to participation may exist. Some teachers have an understanding of how to analyze student work to adjust instruction to meet student needs. Collaborative planning teams have some structures in place to evaluate effectiveness of planning and analysis activities, but these structures may sometimes be interrupted or not consistently used.","School leadership and staff foster a culture of high expectations and rigorous instruction for most students, including multilingual learners, students with disabilities, and students from historically underserved backgrounds. School leadership and staff develop concrete plans for helping most students to engage in standards-aligned, grade-level work and have well-defined instructional expectations. However, some barriers to engaging all students may still exist. Most teachers are familiar with strategies to support high expectations and rigorous instruction, but these strategies may not be used consistently throughout the school.",4.81E+14,"School leadership has established an adequate system for monitoring, observing, and providing feedback to improve instructional quality. Most teachers engage in a comprehensive observation and feedback process designed to encourage self-reflection and drive professional growth. School leadership not only adheres to the required observation and feedback systems and procedures but also conduct occasional classroom observations and walkthroughs with the aid of rubrics or protocols that align with educational standards. School leadership sometimes offers timely, pertinent, and actionable feedback to staff, and this feedback is used to inform general professional development needs and schoolwide instructional priorities.","School leadership and staff use a set of validated assessments to monitor student learning across all grade levels and core content areas at least three times per year. Instructional staff have been allocated collaborative time within grade-level or content teams to analyze student assessment data to determine progress toward intended student and school outcomes at least two times per year. Teams use a variety of student assessment data (e.g., common assessment data, student work) to determine progress and are guided by common data use protocols. Instructional staff teams determine appropriate action steps, but there is no system in place to consistently monitor the results of those actions.","School leadership and staff have established and proactively enhance strategies that cultivate positive interpersonal relationships among adults and students. To support these relationships, school leadership and staff use various structures such as advisories, mentor programs, and smaller learning communities, all of which are designed to promote positive interactions among students and adults while providing valuable social-emotional support. Among staff and between staff and leaders, collegial relations are positive and are supported by schoolwide systems and structures (e.g., collaborative planning, shared understanding of expectations and priorities). Nearly all the staff report having trusting relationships with one another and school leadership.","School leadership and staff prioritize direct instruction of social-emotional competencies, and instruction is often tailored to students’ specific needs. Social-emotional competencies are integrated into classroom instruction and the curriculum, ensuring that they are not only taught but also consistently reinforced and actively monitored for effectiveness. School leadership and staff maintain a safe and nurturing learning environment that encompasses physical, social, emotional, and behavioral aspects. This commitment extends to the implementation of universal teaming structures, healing-centered supports, enrichment and engagement programming, and comprehensive re-entry planning. School leadership and staff have established clear behavioral expectations understood by the school community and have systems and policies to ensure equitable and consistent reinforcement of these expectations.","School leadership and staff have established practices for engaging families as partners in students’ academic and social development. Staff occasionally communicate with primary caregivers to encourage their active involvement in addressing the diverse needs of the whole child. School leadership and staff have prioritized family engagement, consistently fulfilling at least four of the five following key conditions: (a) Dedicated staff members coordinate and lead family engagement activities; (b) A welcoming space is available for families, providing comprehensive information about support services and actively assisting in the planning of family, school, and community events, including referrals to academic, vocational, and college and career readiness programs; (c) Regular activities are well organized and strategically implemented throughout the year, fostering strong collaboration among families and community members, ensuring their valuable input in planning and implementing both academic and nonacademic support; (d) Staff members consistently and proactively reach out to families to convey information regarding their children’s progress and requirements; and (e) Communications are available in multiple languages to accommodate the diverse needs of the school community.","School leadership and staff foster robust connections with several community organizations that provide resources to support school goals and the diverse needs of students. School leadership and staff use traditional and innovative approaches (e.g., social media, partner communication methods) to actively involve community organizations to meet the needs of students, families, and staff members. School leadership and staff utilize a comprehensive system for assessing the evolving needs of students and their families and providing wraparound services (e.g., health and housing referrals) throughout the school year to meet those needs.","School leadership has implemented a system that integrates data and some individualized supports to meet student academic needs and/or students’ social, emotional, and behavioral needs. The system meets at least three of the following criteria for both academic and social-emotional needs (but may lack all four elements for both sets of needs): (a) Intervention assignments are reviewed at least every 6 weeks; (b) Intervention assignments are reviewed by an appropriate team of school staff; (c) Staff members follow consistent rules and procedures when monitoring the delivery and effectiveness of interventions and supports; (d) A schoolwide system exists for communicating intervention action plans to all relevant staff and caregivers. ","Most students have access to individualized support and high-quality, grade-appropriate instruction, grounded in Universal Design for Learning (UDL) practices, and receive individualized support that does not require them to miss substantial core instruction time. Most teachers use instructional scaffolds to differentiate instruction, and these scaffolds are often evident in lesson planning and observed in instruction. However, some barriers (e.g., staffing, scheduling, curricular materials, professional development) exist that hinder consistent implementation. Special education teachers sometimes co-teach or push into classrooms to provide additional support for student learning in core instructional periods. English learners often receive primary language supports through a combination of resources (e.g., dictionaries) or assistive technology (e.g., language applications) and a teacher or paraprofessional. ","Enrichment and advanced learning opportunities (e.g., advanced coursework; clubs; exploratory courses; elective offerings such as arts, music, physical activities, or world languages; and summer school) are available to most students through the school (i.e., during and outside the school day). The opportunities meet two of the following criteria. The opportunities are: (a) informed by student interest or choice; (b) expose students to new skills and interests that enhance classroom experiences; and (c) monitored at least twice throughout the year for quality and to ensure all students are proportionately represented in these opportunities.","Teachers at Sample have many opportunities to participate in teams that oversee various efforts within the school (e.g., Advancement Via Individual Differentiation, attendance, social-emotional learning, and the Universal Leadership Team). In addition to providing staff with leadership opportunities, teams support implementation and monitoring of school improvement initiatives.","Sample communicates to families in multiple languages utilizing dual language staff and written communications in families’ home languages. While the school has successfully engaged diverse families in social activities and events, it currently struggles to engage families in academic activities.","Most staff survey participants agreed or strongly agreed that the school has some basic teaming structures in place, such as an instructional leadership team (100%), grade level teams (97%), school culture team (80%), behavioral health team (85%), college and career planning team (87%) and community engagement team (93%). School leaders agreed or strongly agreed that the school has systems in place to sustain changes these teams have implemented.","The majority of staff survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that school leaders have dedicated time to ensure teachers can align content horizontally (92%) and vertically (80%). School leaders agreed that horizontal content planning occurs regularly, but vertical planning is occurs less frequently.","Staff shared mixed perspectives on the quality of feedback they receive through different avenues. Approximately three quarters of staff survey respondents (78%) reported they received quality feedback from school leaders to improve classroom instruction on at least a quarterly basis. However, staff focus group participants did not consistently find the feedback received through common rubrics or forms helpful for professional growth. Staff focus group participants also noted that frequent informal observations can be disruptive to classrooms and do not consistently contribute to instructional improvement.","Staff focus group participants reported that a decrease in staff turnover has positively impacted the school environment and relationships among colleagues. However, both focus group participants and school leaders recognized there are some areas where staff may not consistently experience positive relationships.","While all school leaders agreed or strongly agreed that the school has a tiered system of academic supports, staff focus group participants indicated that the removal of some key staff support roles has impacted students. For example, while the school utilizes a Reading Recovery teacher, tutors, and Special Education teachers, the school no longer has interventionists or an instructional coach. In addition, focus group participants agreed that more than one tutor per grade level would be beneficial.","Evidence of Student Learning (EJC): While the school offers college and career planning supports, these opportunities may not consistently be monitored for equity of access. School leaders shared divergent perspectives regarding monitoring activities, and 20% of staff survey respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that advanced coursework opportunities are reviewed to ensure equity of access.",,,"Evidence of Learning Conditions (EJC): Most staff survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the school has made changes to academic structures (63%) and school climate structures (79%) based on student feedback. However, school leaders held varying perspectives regarding the extent to which the school has used student feedback to make changes to teaching, curricula, schedules, behavior policies, and school initiatives.","Most of staff survey respondents (72%) agreed or strongly agreed that at their school opportunities are available for work-based learning or career education. In addition, school leader survey participants agreed that students can explore work or career interests virtually or off campus.","School leaders reported that students have several leadership opportunities, including student council (6th, 7th and 8th graders) and a 4th grade ambassador program. In addition, school leaders reported that the school partners with the Elite Community Outreach program, enabling students to join Jr. Elite and participate in supporting the community. ",Established,Established,"Consistent with an established rating, school leadership and staff have established systems for incorporating student voice into decision making through the student council. Students have regular opportunities for feedback through mechanisms like student surveys and informal comments made to teachers. However, Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) scores in the low-middle range suggest opportunities for student voice may not be consistently integrated within or across classrooms.","Consistent with an established rating for this indicator, school leadership and staff have annual plans and activities for supporting college and career readiness for older students, but these are not always individualized. AVID, a program that schools adopt to help close the achievement gap by preparing students for college and career readiness, is a key resource available for students in the 6th, 7th and 8th grades.","Systems and processes for incorporating student perspectives have been established, and school leadership and staff have begun to incorporate student perspectives into decision making. Students have regular opportunities to provide feedback to school leadership, but school leadership and staff are still developing practices to ensure student feedback is used to support and inform continuous improvement of school practices, including teaching, learning, interventions, and school climate.","School leadership has developed a plan for college and career advising and specific activities that occur each school year, but the activities may or may not be aligned from year to year. Most students have access to college and career readiness opportunities (e.g., advanced coursework, such as AP or IB; dual enrollment or early college; work-based learning or CTE) and in at least two settings (e.g., on or off campus; in person and virtual; during the school day, after school, and in the summer), but some barriers to access still exist. There is some effort to individualize college and career planning supports based on students’ needs and interests, but these efforts are inconsistent (e.g., incomplete plans). Parents can seek out postsecondary and career planning conversations with school staff, but these conversations may not be proactively offered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
